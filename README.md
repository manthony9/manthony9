- 👋 Hi, I’m Morris Anthony, a programming student from Ontario, Canada. I changed careers from Operations and IT to  Programming owing to my love from problem solving.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development and AI/ML. Currently starting my journey to become a pro at Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects that want to take in an eager to learn student.
